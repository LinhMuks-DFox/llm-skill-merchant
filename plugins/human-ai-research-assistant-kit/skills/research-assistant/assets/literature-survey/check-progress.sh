# Literature-survey helper — resumable-progress check.
# Reports which expected review notes already exist. The checkpoint is the
# FILESYSTEM: every note that finished is on disk, independent of any session or
# workflow memory. Run this after a usage-limit interruption to see what is left,
# then re-run the (idempotent) deep-read workflow to fill only the gaps.

# Assumes the manifest has a numbered markdown table whose LAST column per
# numbered row is the Note filename. Edit MANIFEST and NOTEDIR per survey.
