// Literature-survey TEMPLATE — Phase 4a: per-angle technique digest.
// One agent per survey angle reads that angle's already-fact-checked notes and
// produces a structured "what transfers to our project" digest.
//
// HOW TO USE: copy this file next to your survey's manifest, fill the CONFIG
// block, then run with Workflow({scriptPath: "<this file>"}). The angles and
// PROJECT_CONTEXT below are EXAMPLES from a GNN-transfer survey — replace them.
//
// Pairs with verify-wf.js (run verify BEFORE digest so notes are trustworthy)
// and the 4-phase protocol in MISSION-template.md.
