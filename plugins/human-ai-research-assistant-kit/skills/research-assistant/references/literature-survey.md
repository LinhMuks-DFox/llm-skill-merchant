# Literature Survey Mode (AI-Dug Papers)

Use when the human asks to survey a topic, dig prior work, or build a reading list — typically via fan-out sub-agents, or via an external deep-research tool (see "Deep-research prompt generation"). Three deliverable types, all or some per request:

1. **Survey synthesis** — convergent findings, delivered in chat and/or folded into a research log section.
2. **Per-paper review notes** — written into the vault's `AI-Dug-Papers/` (NOT `PaperReview/`, which is reserved for the human's own reading).
3. **Deep-research prompt** — a self-contained prompt for ChatGPT Deep Research or similar.

## Search discipline (academic rules — apply to every agent and every prompt)

1. **Source hierarchy**: peer-reviewed venue (journal / conference proceedings) > arXiv preprint > workshop paper > technical blog. Preprints must be labeled as preprints; check whether a published version exists and cite that instead. Blogs are background only — never citable evidence.
2. **Verify venue and year from the paper itself** (PDF header / official venue page), never from search snippets or secondary citations.
3. **Read before claiming**: every number, equation, or recipe detail in a note must come from the PDF actually read. If a paper is paywalled or unreadable, mark the entry LOW-CONFIDENCE and do not cite implementation details from it.
4. **Originals over surveys**: claims cite the original paper; survey papers are for mapping the field only.
5. **Dedupe first**: before writing a note, check the Zotero library, `PaperReview/`, and `AI-Dug-Papers/` for an existing entry; update rather than duplicate.
6. **Negative results are first-class**: reported failures, instabilities, and "we switched away from X because" findings are explicitly in scope and often the most valuable output.
7. **Convergence rule**: a synthesis claim may be called "convergent" only with ≥ 2 independent sources; otherwise attribute it to its single source.
8. **Lineage tracing**: for methods, note what the field later replaced them with and why — a method's abandonment history is evidence.
9. **Record code and data availability** per paper.
10. **Every entry carries**: title, venue + year, arXiv ID / DOI, URL.

## Per-paper note format

- Location: vault `AI-Dug-Papers/<YYYY-MM>/<YYYY - Title>.md` (filename: year, " - ", title with ":" replaced by " - ").
- Frontmatter (ZoteroImport-derived contract — dashboards depend on these fields):

```yaml
---
type: paper
citekey: "<authorKeywordYear>"
title: "<full title>"
authors: "<comma-separated>"
publication: "<venue>"
year: "<YYYY>"
date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
url: "<arxiv abs / venue url>"
zotero_link: ""            # empty until imported to Zotero
pdf_link: "[<pdf file>](file://<absolute local path>)"
status: reading            # AI NEVER sets read — read means the human personally read it
origin: ai-survey
tags:
  - research
  - AI-dug
  - <topical tags>
---
```

- Body sections (match the human's PaperReview style): Abstract callout (verbatim) → `#### Summary` (核心问题 / 方法（配方细节）/ 实验与关键数字) → `#### 杂谈 + 思考 + 批判` (genuine critique + relevance to the current project) → `#### Relation` (link the project note and sibling reviews).
- Writing rules: Chinese plain short sentences; expand abbreviations at first use; math in LaTeX `$...$`; no metaphor pile-ups; no AI attribution inside the note body.
- PDFs: download to the project's `reference/<topic>/` with naming `YYYY-Venue-Author-Keyword-<arxivId>.pdf`; `pdf_link` points there.
- Dashboard: `AI-Dug-Papers TOC.md` (dataview) picks notes up automatically if the frontmatter contract is respected.

## Citing AI-dug papers in research logs

- Link normally: `[[YYYY - Title]]`.
- A claim taken from an AI note the human has not personally read carries the marker 「出自 AI 精读，未亲核」. Drop the marker once the note's status flips to `read`.
- Any claim a design decision rests on must be re-verified by the human in the PDF, or explicitly accepted as AI-verified in the log.

## Fan-out orchestration (sub-agent surveys)

1. Split by **theme angle** (3-5 agents with distinct perspectives: e.g. by application domain / by method family / by failure-mode focus), not by paper count.
2. Each agent prompt must include: the search-discipline rules (condensed); the project-relevance paragraph (so critique sections judge applicability, write it fresh per survey); the full intended note-filename list (so cross-links resolve); the note template; instruction to read the PDF before writing and to return only a one-line-per-file final message.
3. The orchestrator (not the agents) writes the synthesis: convergent findings with source counts, contradictions flagged, then folds it into the research log. Per-paper detail stays in the notes.
4. Long-running fan-outs: run agents in background; if an agent dies (session limit, errors), the orchestrator re-launches its share — keep a written spec of assignments so relaunching is mechanical.

## Workflow-orchestrated survey (the heavy pipeline)

For a large survey (tens of papers, multiple angles, must survive usage-limit interruptions), drive it with the `Workflow` tool instead of hand-launched agents. Reusable scripts and a protocol skeleton live in `assets/literature-survey/` — copy them next to the survey's manifest, fill the CONFIG block at the top of each, and run.

Four phases (see `assets/literature-survey/MISSION-template.md` for the full protocol with STATE / RESUME sections):

1. **Search** — light model (sonnet/haiku), N parallel agents, one per angle, each writes `findings-<angle>.md` (8-12 papers/angle). Inline the context/angles into the script — passing them via `name:+args` can fail (the `args` global is not always injected), so the survey agent reads a hardcoded context and `Write`s its findings file.
2. **Dedupe + download** — orchestrator dedupes across angles, excludes already-owned papers (the manifest's exclusion list), selects ~N, builds `review-manifest.md` (numbered table: `# | Title | Venue+Year | Primary angle | PDF filename | Note filename`), and downloads PDFs via `download.sh` (reads a `## Download list` fenced block of `url|filename.pdf`, validates the `%PDF` magic, idempotent).
3. **Deep-read** — strong model (opus), ≤4 papers/agent, writing notes per "Per-paper note format" above. **Must be idempotent**: each agent checks whether its target note is already complete and SKIPs if so.
4. **Verify → digest → synthesize → report** — `verify-wf.js` runs one adversarial fact-checker per note (re-reads the PDF as ground truth, audits factual / method-fidelity / transfer-analysis axes, fixes in place, returns `FIXED` / `PASS` / `FLAG`); then `digest-wf.js` runs one agent per angle to produce `digest-<angle>.md` (ranked high/mid/low transferability, each high tied to a concrete adoption target); then the orchestrator hand-writes `synthesis-draft.md` and the research log, and runs a final dead-link check.

**Resume after interruption — checkpoint is the filesystem.** Every finished note is on disk, independent of session/workflow memory. After a usage-limit reset: `bash check-progress.sh` reports written-vs-missing, then re-launch the (idempotent) deep-read workflow with `Workflow({scriptPath})` — completed notes SKIP instantly. Within the same session, `resumeFromRunId` reuses cached agent results; across sessions the cache is gone, so the per-agent SKIP guard carries resume. Run verify before digest, always.

## Deep-research prompt generation (ChatGPT etc.)

When the human asks for a deep-research prompt instead of (or in addition to) a sub-agent survey, emit ONE self-contained prompt block containing, in order:

1. **Context** — project background written fresh for a zero-context reader (no internal jargon without definition).
2. **Research questions** — 3-7, ranked by priority, each answerable by literature.
3. **Search constraints** — the search-discipline rules above, condensed to a numbered list (source hierarchy, verify venues, originals over surveys, negative results in scope, convergence rule).
4. **Required output format** — per-paper structured entries (title | venue+year | arXiv/DOI | method recipe | hyperparameters | verification protocol | one-line takeaway) + a synthesis section with convergence counts + an explicit "not found / uncertain" section.
5. **Exclusion list** — papers already reviewed (titles), so the tool digs new ground.

Deliver inline in chat, and save a copy under the project root (e.g. `deep_research_prompt_<topic>.md`) when the human wants to reuse it. Results coming back from the external tool are treated as UNVERIFIED leads: before any claim enters a note or log, fetch and read the actual paper per the search discipline above.
